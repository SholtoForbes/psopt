#summary PSOPT - A pseudospectral optimal control solver in C++

= Introduction =

*PSOPT* is an open source optimal control package implementing a pseudospectral discretization method. This is a way of solving optimal
control problems which discretizes the problem using orthogonal polynomials,
so that it can be solved using nonlinear programming methods. *PSOPT* is able to deal with problems
with the following characteristics:

  * Single or multiphase problems

  * Continuous time nonlinear dynamics

  * General endpoint constraints

  * Nonlinear path constraints 

  * Integral constraints

  * Interior point constraints

  * Bounds on controls and state variables

  * General cost function with Lagrange and Mayer terms.

  * Free or fixed initial and final conditions

  * Linear or nonlinear linkages between phases

  * Fixed or free initial time

  * Fixed or free final time

  * Optimisation of static parameters


= Features =
The implementation has the following features:

  * Automatic scaling

  * Automatic differentiation using the ADOL-C library

  * Numerical differentiation by using sparse finite differences

  * Automatic identification of the Jacobian sparsity

  * DAE formulation, so that differential and algebraic constraints can be implemented in the same C++ function.

= Interfaces =
PSOPT has interfaces to the following NLP solvers:

  * [http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/documentation/ IPOPT]: an open source C++ implementation of an interior point method for large scale problems.

  * [http://www.sbsi-sol-optimize.com/asp/sol_product_snopt.htm SNOPT]: a well known and widely used proprietary large scale NLP solver.
