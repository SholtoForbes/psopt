= Introduction =

PSOPT is an open source optimal control package implementing a Legendre
pseudospectral discretisation method. This is a method for solving optimal
control problems which uses a collocation method based on polynomial interpolation
to discretize the differential equations, as well as nonlinear programming
to find local optimal solutions. MPSOC is able to deal with problems
with the following characteristics:
- Single or multiphase problems
- Continuous time nonlinear dynamics
- General endpoint constraints
- Nonlinear path constraints 
- Integral constraints
- Interior point constraints
- Bounds on controls and state variables
- General cost function with Lagrange and Mayer terms.
- Free or fixed initial and final conditions
- Linear or nonlinear linkages between phases
- Fixed or free initial time
- Fixed or free final time
- Optimisation of static parameters


= Features =
The implementation has the following features:
- Automatic scaling
- Automatic differentiation using the ADOL-C library
- Numerical differentiation by using sparse finite differences
- Automatic identification of the Jacobian sparsity
- DAE formulation, so that differential and algebraic constraints can be
implemented in the same C++ function.

= Interfaces
PSOPT has interfaces to the following NLP solvers:
- IPOPT: an open source C++ implementation of an interior point method
for large scale problems.
- SNOPT: a well known and widely used proprietary large scale NLP solver.
