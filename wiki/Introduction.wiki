#summary PSOPT - A Pseudospectral Optimal Control Solver in C++

= Introduction =

*PSOPT* is an open source optimal control package written in C++ that uses pseudospectral discretisation methods. 
These methods solve optimal control problems by approximatimg the time-dependent variables using orthogonal polynomials.
This allows to discretize the differential equations and continuous constraints
over a grid of nodes, and to compute the any integrals associated with the problem using well known quadrature formulas. 
Nonlinear programming then is used to find local optimal
solutions. *PSOPT* is able to deal with problems with the following characteristics:


  * Single or multiphase problems

  * Continuous time nonlinear dynamics

  * General endpoint constraints

  * Nonlinear path constraints 

  * Integral constraints

  * Interior point constraints

  * Bounds on controls and state variables

  * General cost function with Lagrange and Mayer terms.

  * Free or fixed initial and final conditions

  * Linear or nonlinear linkages between phases

  * Fixed or free initial time

  * Fixed or free final time

  * Optimisation of static parameters


= Features =
The implementation has the following features:

  * Choice between Legendre or Chebyshev polynomial approximation

  * Automatic scaling

  * Automatic differentiation using the [http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~adol-c/ ADOL-C] library

  * Numerical differentiation by using sparse finite differences

  * Automatic identification of the Jacobian sparsity

  * DAE formulation, so that differential and algebraic constraints can be implemented in the same C++ function.

  * Easy to use interface to GNUplot to produce graphical output.

= Interfaces to NLP solvers =

PSOPT has interfaces to the following NLP solvers:

  * [http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/documentation/ IPOPT]: an open source C++ implementation of an interior point method for large scale problems.

  * [http://www.sbsi-sol-optimize.com/asp/sol_product_snopt.htm SNOPT]: a well known and widely used proprietary large scale NLP solver.



= Why use PSOPT  =

These are some reasons why users may wish to use PSOPT


  * Users who for any reason do not have access to commercial optimal control solvers and wish to employ a free open source package for optimal control which does not need a proprietary software environment to run on.

  * Users who need to link an optimal control solver from a C++ application.

  * Users who want to do research with the software, for instance by implementing their own problems, or by customising the code.


PSOPT does not require a commercial software environment to run on, 
or to be compiled. PSOPT is fully compatible with the [http://gcc.gnu.org/ GCC] compiler, and has
been developed under Linux, a free operating system. The software has also been ported to compile under Windows XP/Vista using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. 
There is an optional interface to the nonlinear programming solver SNOPT.
Note also that the default NLP solver (IPOPT) requires a sparse linear solver
from a range of options, some of which are available at no cost. The author has personally used the linear solver ma27.
